# Make Digitalization Easier for All

Despite so many technological advancements over the years, we still encounter significant hurdles in the path of digitalization.

## The Challenges

For businesses:
* High and unpredictable costs
* Lengthy and uncertain delivery times

For developers:
* Programming is only a part of the lifecycle of business solutions. A more and more complex technology stack prevents individuals or small teams to be able to delvier software solutions.
* Opportunities are limited not by talent or technology, but by factors such as geographical location and age.

## The Need for Digital Transformation in Software Delivery Itself

While we've made significant strides in accelerating digital transformation across various industries, the software industry itself may still need more attention. We now have superior tools, languages, and cloud infrastructures and now AI, but the way we collaborate to develop software hasn't evolved as much. We often need to be in close proximity, if not in the same location, and speak the same language to communicate effectively, often hinders developers from serving businesses in need.


## A Better Way Forward?

I am convinced that there is a better way. After years of contemplation and experimentation, I believe we are ready to take a step forward to address this issue. This is the premise on which Appbnr was founded.
