# Data first

Data forms the backbone of your business. So why are today's digital solutions primarily function-focused, with data considerations often an afterthought?

## What

In Appbnr, we put data in the center, we consider data as first priority. Applications are constructed around data, not vice versa. Instead of duplicating data and allowing it to flow between applications, all applications share the same data, the single source of truth.

## How

AIndeed, we concur that data should take precedence, but executing this strategy isn't always feasible. In the early stages of development, data is often an abstract concept, discussed theoretically rather than practically.

Appbnr, as a _Data Centric Application Platform_, makes the data-first approach viable. Data can be defined and pre-populated in the initial stages, accessible to everyone from the outset.

But we don't stop there. Apps from the same organization can begin integrating with your data even before your app is fully developed. This way, your progress won't hinder theirs.

That's why everyone [Speaks in Data](speak-in-data.md) on our platform.
