# Transaction based

Working with Appbnr, you pay for the solution only when it's delivered and you're satisfied with it.
It is very similiar to you to buy a gadget from a online store.

## Transaction is a new relationship between business and developers

Traditionally, business can get developers work for them in two ways:

* Hire: make developers as their employees and pay by month
* Contract: make developers as their contractors and pay by contract. Sometimes we call this Outsource model

Both works for certain companies, but it's very challenging for most of others, especially SMEs. 

Take adminstrative risk and technical risk as example, 
* Hire: business takes care both administrative and technical risks
* Contract: business takes technical risks but leave administrative risks to somebody else.

We can see, contract model takes administrative risk out from business concern, but still, technical risks with business. But most of companies, especially SMEs, may not be able to manage technical risks at al.

We propose Transaction mode.

## Transaction: What you pay is what you get

Business pay to get digitalization solutions, while developers expect to get paid for their deliveries. This is agreed. The question is on how?

In trasaction model, payment and delivery happening at the same time. In this way, both administrative and technical risks are out of business concerns.

And of cause, this model may be new in digital solution delivery business, but other industries already having this one for long. For example, online shops.

Appbnr is a Data Centric Application Platform, it's designed to make this transaction based approach possible
