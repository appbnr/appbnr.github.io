# Speak in Data

On Appbnr platform, everyone talks in data. 

## Data is a language

Features come and go, but data will stay with you. Data tells what has happened, 
what is happening, and what will happen. Data once available and presented, is the 
most easy media to build trust.

Data is considered a language because it provides a universal means of communication. 
It transcends traditional language barriers and allows for clear, objective interpretation
 of information. Much like how verbs and grammar give structure to spoken languages, 
 operations like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) or insert, select, update, 
 and delete (ISUD) in SQL provide structure to data. Tools and languages have been developed 
 to define data, and these definitions are widely accepted and understood, making data a 
 universal language that ensures everyone is on the same page.
