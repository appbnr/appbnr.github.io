# Agile delivery

While others discuss agile development, we champion Agile Delivery. Your digital transformation goals will be achieved, one delivery at a time.

## Agile delivery, not development

Agile development is beneficial, but it has its limitations. You often have to wait until all milestones are achieved before you can reap the benefits. You might have already invested heavily, but you don't have anything tangible yet.

That's where Agile Delivery comes in. Each milestone is a delivery, and typically, developers can deliver one milestone and make it live for you to use in a very short timeframe. Thanks to our [Transaction-based](transaction-based.md) model, you only pay for what you see live, allowing you to immediately gain from your investment.

## One delivery at a time

Just as in a hiking expedition, you advance one step at a time. There may be pauses, detours for various legitimate reasons. In the end, you arrive at your destination. And then, you start planning your next journey.

Your digital transformation is a similar expedition. Your vision is grand, but actualizing that vision takes time. With the Agile Delivery model on the Appbnr platform, you can construct your digital transformation piece by piece. All these incremental deliveries will eventually lead you to your goal.
