> Creating multiple organizations is generally discouraged, as resources are managed at the organization level.
> For instance, identical apps installed across different organizations may incur additional charges, even if they're managed by the same user.

> Be mindful when choosing your organization's code and name. Avoid creating organizations that could infringe on copyright or trademark laws. For instance, don't attempt to create an organization using well-known corporation names unless you have the necessary authorization.
